  Thanks for giving the ${pkg.name} a try. ðŸŽ‰

  ## To get you going really quickly this project includes a setup step.
  // ${chalk.yellow.bold("package.json")}
  {
    "scripts": {
        "plop": "plop --plopfile ./node_modules/modern-project-generator/plopfile.ts"
    },
    ...
  }

  ${chalk.yellow.bold("npm run setup")} automates the following step for you:
    - add npm script to file ${chalk.yellow("./package.json")}

  When this is done run:

  ${chalk.yellow(
    "npm run plop"
  )} to use the monorepo project generator and follow the prompts.
